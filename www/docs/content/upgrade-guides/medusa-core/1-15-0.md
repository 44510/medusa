# v1.15.0

Version 1.15.0 of Medusa comes with improvements to the Import and Export features, leading to several breaking changes.

## Overview

This release contains breaking changes in the Import Export and File Service domains.

Reading and writing streams with file plugins now default to a private bucket across all providers.

The file plugin streaming API to upload to public/private buckets has been updated to be consistent across all providers. 

```ts
// before
// MinIO
fileService.getUploadStreamDescriptor({..., usePrivateBucket: false})
// S3 & Spaces
fileService.getUploadStreamDescriptor({..., acl: "public-read"})

// after
fileService.getUploadStreamDescriptor({..., isPrivate: true}) // private bucket (default)
fileService.getUploadStreamDescriptor({..., isPrivate: false}) // public bucket
```

The following method signatures in the Price List and Product import strategies have been updated:
```ts
// before
downloadImportOpsFile(batchJobId: string, op: OperationType)
deleteOpsFiles(batchJobId: string)

// after
downloadImportOpsFile(batchJob: BatchJob, op: OperationType)
deleteOpsFiles(batchJob: BatchJob)
```

The following types specific to file services have moved from `@medusajs/medusa` to `@medusajs/types`:
```ts
export type FileServiceUploadResult = {
  url: string
  key: string
}

export type FileServiceGetUploadStreamResult = {
  writeStream: stream.PassThrough
  promise: Promise<any>
  url: string
  fileKey: string
  [x: string]: unknown
}

export type GetUploadedFileType = {
  fileKey: string
  isPrivate?: boolean
  [x: string]: unknown
}

export type DeleteFileType = {
  fileKey: string
  [x: string]: unknown
}

export type UploadStreamDescriptorType = {
  name: string
  ext?: string
  isPrivate?: boolean
  [x: string]: unknown
}
```

## How to Update

Run the following command in the root directory of your Medusa Backend:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @medusajs/medusa@1.15.0
```

To avoid unexpected issues with dependencies, it is also recommended to update all other Medusa plugins or packages you have installed.
