# Meilisearch Search: v1.0.0

Version 1.0.0 of the official Meilisearch plugin comes with breaking changes to the plugin options that are passed to the Meilisearch service through `medusa-config.js`.

## Overview

In the new version of the Meilisearch search plugin, two new plugin configuration properties are introduced; `transformer` and `primaryKey`.  As a result, the way indexes in Meilisearch are configured has changed. 

The new object shape for the plugin options is as follows:

```jsx
{
  config: {
		host: string
		apiKey: string
	}
  settings: {
    [indexName]: {
      indexSettings: {
        searchableAttributes: string[]
        displayedAttributes: string[]
				...
      }
      transformer?: <T>(medusaEntity: T) => unknown
    }
  }
}
```

## Actions required

As you can see from the new object shape, the property `indexSettings` has been introduced to hold the settings specific to Meilisearchâ€™s index options. This has been done to make space for new settings like `transformer` and `primaryKey`. 

Previously, you might have configured the Meilisearch plugin as seen below:

```jsx
{
  config: {
		host: "https://search-api-example.com",
    apiKey: "some_key",
	}
  settings: {
    products: {
      searchableAttributes: ["title", "description"],
      attributesToRetrieve: ["title", "description"],
		}
  }
}
```

In the above example, an index `products` has been configured with the two options `searchableAttributes` and `attributesToRetrieve`. Updating to 1.0.0 requires you to nest these options within the `indexSettings`. 

The updated plugin options would look like so:

```jsx
{
  config: {
		host: "https://search-api-example.com",
    apiKey: "some_key",
	}
  settings: {
    products: {
			indexSettings: {
	      searchableAttributes: ["title", "description"],
	      attributesToRetrieve: ["title", "description"],	
			}
		}
  }
}
```
